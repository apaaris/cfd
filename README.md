# cfd

Repo for the cfd stuff I'm trying to learn.

Not meant to be really clone and play, however everything should be replicable with OpenFoam8.
To skip directly to the results:

```console
$ paraview foam.foam&
```
**Important: constant/polyMesh and data.cgns are ignored as too large for GitHub.**
